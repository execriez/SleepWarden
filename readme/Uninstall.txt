UNINSTALLING:


Open the Terminal app, and download the latest SleepWarden-Uninstaller.pkg uninstaller to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/SleepWarden/master/SupportFiles/SleepWarden-Uninstaller.pkg --output ~/Desktop/SleepWarden-Uninstaller.pkg


To uninstall, double-click the downloaded package.

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

	/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.sleepwarden.plist
	/usr/SleepWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and sleep events will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
