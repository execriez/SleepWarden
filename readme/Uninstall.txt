UNINSTALLING:

Download the SleepWarden uninstaller package here:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/SleepWarden/master/SupportFiles/SleepWarden-Uninstaller.pkg

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

   /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.sleepwarden.plist
   /usr/SleepWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and sleep events will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
