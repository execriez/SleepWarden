INSTALLATION:

Open the Terminal app, and download the latest SleepWarden.pkg installer to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/SleepWarden/master/SupportFiles/SleepWarden.pkg --output ~/Desktop/SleepWarden.pkg

To install, double-click the downloaded package.

The installer will install the following files and directories:

	/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.sleepwarden.plist
	/usr/SleepWarden/
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-IdleSleep
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-WillSleep
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-WillWake
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-HasWoken

There's no need to reboot.

After installation, your computer will write to the log file /tmp/SleepWarden.log whenever there is a sleep event. 

If the installer fails you should check the installation logs.


MODIFYING THE EXAMPLE SCRIPTS:

After installation, four simple example scripts can be found in the following location:

	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-IdleSleep
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-WillSleep
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-WillWake
	/usr/SleepWarden/bin/SleepWarden-HasWoken

These scripts simply write to the log file /tmp/SleepWarden.log whenever there is a sleep event. Modify the scripts to your own needs.


You should note that there is at most a 60 second delay between an **IdleSleep** event and the system actually going to sleep.

Also, there is at most a 30 second delay between a **WillSleep** event and the system going to sleep.

You should aim at having all your scripts complete within the appropriate timeframes.


LOGS:

The example scripts write to the following log file:

	/tmp/SleepWarden.log

The installer writes to the following log file:

	/Library/Logs/com.github.execriez.sleepwarden.log
  
You should check this log if there are issues when installing.
